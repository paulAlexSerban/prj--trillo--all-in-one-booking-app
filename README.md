# Trillo All-in-One-Booking-App

## Project Brief

Trillo is a fictional All-in-One Booking App that will allow users to book a hotel, a flight, a car, and a tour all in one platform. Currently, the project is in the frontend mockup stage, built using modern technologies and best practices in web development. The mockup is a single-page application that is fully responsive, accessible, and optimized for search engines.

## Goal Details

The goal of the Trillo project is to create a seamless booking experience for users who want to book multiple travel services in one place. The final version of the application will be developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). The application should be visually appealing, user-friendly, and provide all necessary information to potential customers. The project aims to provide a high-quality user experience and follows a "Think-Build-Architect" mindset.

### Target Audience

The target audience for Trillo is people who enjoy traveling and are interested in booking multiple travel services in one platform. This includes both local and international tourists who are looking for a convenient and hassle-free booking experience.

## Promise

Trillo promises to offer a comprehensive booking experience that allows customers to easily book multiple travel services in one place. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and efficient, providing customers with a stress-free booking experience.

## Architecture

The frontend mockup of the Trillo project uses the following technologies and best practices:

- Scss preprocessor: Scss is used to write more efficient and maintainable CSS code.
- Flexbox Layout: Flexbox layout is implemented for cross-browser compatibility and responsive design.
- Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript: The JavaScript code is organized using Object Oriented Programming principles, making it easier to read, maintain, and extend.
- Component-based development: The front-end is built using a component-based approach, which promotes reusability and makes it easier to manage complex UIs.
- '7-1 Pattern' folder structure: The folder structure follows the '7-1 Pattern' to organize partial Scss files and promote maintainability.
- BEM for CSS class naming convention and architecture: BEM (Block Element Modifier) is used to name and structure CSS classes in a way that is easy to read and maintain.
- DRY coding principles: Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) coding principles are followed to promote code reusability and reduce redundancy.

## Infrastructure

The Trillo project will use the following infrastructure:

- Version control system: Git will be used to manage the project's source code and version control.
- Hosting: The final version of the application will be hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS).
- CI/CD: The continuous integration and deployment process will be automated using GitHub Actions, making it faster and more reliable.

## Tech Stack

The Trillo project will use the following technologies:

- Markup and Templating: HTML, Handlebars
- Styles and Layout: CSS, Sass/Scss
- User Experience: JavaScript, React
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB
- Hosting: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Git

## System Design

The final version of the Trillo project will use the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, which is a popular and powerful technology stack for building modern web applications. The project will use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host the application and AWS CodePipeline to automate the continuous integration and deployment process.

## Post-MVP Improvements

### Functional Improvements:

- Integration with third-party APIs to provide more accurate pricing and availability information for travel services.
- Addition of a reviews section to showcase user experiences and promote the Trillo brand.
- Integration with a payment gateway to allow customers to securely and easily pay for their bookings.

### Non-Functional Improvements:

- Optimization of images and other media to improve page loading times.
- Implementation of lazy loading and other performance optimizations to improve page speed.
- Implementation of accessibility best practices to ensure the website is usable by people with disabilities.

## Conclusion

The Trillo project is a well-designed and well-architected All-in-One Booking App that will provide a seamless booking experience for users who want to book multiple travel services in one platform. The project will use modern technologies and best practices in web development to provide a high-quality user experience. With the use of the MERN stack and AWS infrastructure, the Trillo project can become an even more successful and effective platform for booking travel services.
